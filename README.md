For assignment application of derivative in medicine

Speed of axon conduction

#Intro
It was reasonable for people to think that why they need to learn math in university because they think it will not use just do for examination. However, Mathemetic have been using in every part of life but they do not notice about that due to knowledge was change. This report will explained you about using calculus in medical

#Axon conduction velocity
Neuron cell contains three major part such as dendrite, soma, and axon. Normally, It has cell membrane which is phospholipid bilayer and seperate Na ion more in the outer cell and K ion more in the inner cell .In additionally, they have three main type of channels. Firstly, Unconjugated or leakage channel which contains Na and K channel allow both K with Na pass through cell membrane by electric flow. Secondly, conjugated channel such as ligated, machanic, and electric that have Na and K channel too.

When the stimuli come Na unconjugated channel will open, Na pass through cell membrane make ion become more positive, then activate other Na channel to open,

let me talk about axon and how to calculate speed of conduction
